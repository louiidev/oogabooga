## v0.01.009 - Better shaders & Audio fixes

	- Audio
		- Improved spacialization API
			- renamed Audio_Playback_Config.position_ndc -> Audio_Playback_Config.position
			- Added Audio_Playback_Config spacial_projection & spacial_listener_xform
				- Audio_Playback_Config.position can now be in your world space
				- spacial_projection & spacial_listener_xform is the same as Draw_Frame.projection & Draw_Frame.camera_xform but for the audio spacialization
			- Refactored audio a bit to get its intermediate buffers from one large mega buffer
			- Fixed the short fade in/out on pausing/playing without noise
			- Added audio_player_transition_to_source() which makes a player fade to another source for a given amount of seconds
			
	- Graphics
		- Reworked shader extension system so you can make multiple Gfx_Shader_Extension and use them per Draw_Frame render.
			- gfx_destroy_shader_extension()
			- gfx_compile_shader_extension()
		- Added Draw_Frame.shader_extension (which you set before gfx_render_draw_frame for it to be used)
			Not setting this or setting it to {0} means default shader is used.
		- Added draw_frame_bind_image_to_shader()
			We can now directly bind an image to a hlsl texture slot that we can sample from
		- Made examples/bloom.c example which shows how you can do post-processing effects like bloom.
		- Fixed a bug where the window would maximize to fill all monitors rather than the current one
		- Fixed a bug where when more than 32 images were used in the same Draw_Frame, the wrong textures would start getting drawn.
	
	- Misc
		- Added parsing functions string_to_int and string_to_float
		- Fixed Vector(N)64's to actually use float64's instead of float32's (whoops)
		- VERTEX_2D_USER_DATA_COUNT -> VERTEX_USER_DATA_COUNT
		- Minor refactors, cleanup, bugfixes
			
			
			

## v0.01.008 - hotfix
- Unbroke gfx_reserve_vbo_bytes

## v0.01.007 - Offscreen rendering, Draw_Frame's, Major reworks, more examples

	- Graphics
		- Implemented render-target versions of Gfx_Image
		- Added functions for offscreen rendering:
			- make_image_render_target()
			- gfx_render_draw_frame(Draw_Frame, Gfx_Image*)
			- (and gfx_render_draw_frame_to_window(Draw_Frame) to render draw_frame directly to window)
			See examples/offscreen_drawing.c for a practical example.
		- Reworked the Draw_Frame's & drawing API
			- Instead of targetting the global draw_frame, all drawing functions now make a call to draw_xxx_in_frame and passes &draw_frame as the last parameter.
			- So, we added draw_xxx_in_frame overloads which means we can now draw to other Draw_Frame's than the global one.
			- While the global draw_frame is still reset & rendered in gfx_update(), we can now manage separate draw_frame's manually with:
				void draw_frame_init(Draw_Frame *frame);
				void draw_frame_init_reserve(Draw_Frame *frame, u64 number_of_quads_to_reserve);
				void draw_frame_reset(Draw_Frame *frame);
			- See examples/threaded_drawing.c which dedicates a Draw_Frame to each thread to split up the drawing, and then render them on the main thread.
			- Complete list of new drawing API functions:
				void draw_frame_init(Draw_Frame *frame);
				void draw_frame_init_reserve(Draw_Frame *frame, u64 number_of_quads_to_reserve);
				void draw_frame_reset(Draw_Frame *frame);
				Draw_Quad *draw_quad_projected_in_frame(Draw_Quad quad, Matrix4 world_to_clip, Draw_Frame *frame);
				Draw_Quad *draw_quad_in_frame(Draw_Quad quad, Draw_Frame *frame);
				Draw_Quad *draw_quad_xform_in_frame(Draw_Quad quad, Matrix4 xform, Draw_Frame *frame);
				Draw_Quad *draw_rect_in_frame(Vector2 position, Vector2 size, Vector4 color, Draw_Frame *frame);
				Draw_Quad *draw_rect_xform_in_frame(Matrix4 xform, Vector2 size, Vector4 color, Draw_Frame *frame);
				Draw_Quad *draw_circle_in_frame(Vector2 position, Vector2 size, Vector4 color, Draw_Frame *frame);
				Draw_Quad *draw_circle_xform_in_frame(Matrix4 xform, Vector2 size, Vector4 color, Draw_Frame *frame);
				Draw_Quad *draw_image_in_frame(Gfx_Image *image, Vector2 position, Vector2 size, Vector4 color, Draw_Frame *frame);
				Draw_Quad *draw_image_xform_in_frame(Gfx_Image *image, Matrix4 xform, Vector2 size, Vector4 color, Draw_Frame *frame);
				void draw_line_in_frame(Vector2 p0, Vector2 p1, float line_width, Vector4 color, Draw_Frame *frame);
				void draw_text_xform_in_frame(Gfx_Font *font, string text, u32 raster_height, Matrix4 xform, Vector2 scale, Vector4 color, Draw_Frame *frame);
				void draw_text_in_frame(Gfx_Font *font, string text, u32 raster_height, Vector2 position, Vector2 scale, Vector4 color, Draw_Frame *frame);
				Gfx_Text_Metrics draw_text_and_measure_in_frame(Gfx_Font *font, string text, u32 raster_height, Vector2 position, Vector2 scale, Vector4 color, Draw_Frame *frame);
				void push_z_layer_in_frame(s32 z, Draw_Frame *frame);
				void pop_z_layer_in_frame(Draw_Frame *frame);
				void push_window_scissor_in_frame(Vector2 min, Vector2 max, Draw_Frame *frame);
				void pop_window_scissor_in_frame(Draw_Frame *frame);

			- Vector2 and Vector2i as well as v2_ and v2i_ functions are typedeffed / #defined to Vector2f32 and Vector2s32
			- Vector interpolation functions:
				v2_lerp
				v3_lerp
				v4_lerp
				v2_smerp
				v3_smerp
				v4_smerp
		- Changed profiling to measure in seconds
